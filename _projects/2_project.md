The world at large has dependend on coal and natural gas (i.e., fossil fuels) to provide energy for centuries. Despite this reliance, it became known in the 20th Century that emissions of carbon dioxide resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels were detrimental to the Earth's atmosphere because of enhanced warming. As a result, countries have begun adopting more progressive methods for producing energy, broadly termed renewable energy. These methods of extraction include wind and solar, which inherently depend upon the atmospheric conditions. In my research, I utilize numerical models to improve the prediction of winds and shortwave radiation.
