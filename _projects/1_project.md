Some of the most destructive disasters, not only in the U.S. but across the globe, have been due to wildfires. Historically, much research focus has been placed on fires occurring in regions mostly uninhabited by humans, generally called wildland fires. However, urban sprawl has exploded over the past several decades, leading to the development of the so-called wildland urban interface or WUI. A number of notable WUI fires have recently devasted communities, oftentimes due to intense windstorms or other meteorologically-important events. My research is especially interested in the linkage between weather and wildfire behavior on time scales spanning minutes to days. You can find out more about my wildfire research below.
