Hi there, welcome to my site!

I'm an atmospheric scientist at NCAR and am broadly interested in boundary layers and turbulence. The boundary layer is the lowest part of the atmosphere in which we live and where all the cool stuff happens. I am especially curious about problems involving numerical weather prediction, with specific interests spanning wildfires, renewable energy, clouds, and interactions across spatial scales. Before joining NCAR as a Postdoctoral Fellow in 2019, I earned my B.S. degree in Meteorology from Milersville University and my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Atmospheric Science from the University of Wyoming.

You can find more information about my research happenings on this site. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out!
