Hi there, I'm Tim! Welcome to my site.

<!-- My journey to becoming an atmospheric scientist started many years ago -- in 1996, to be exact. I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, where we got to experience all the seasons. Despite numerous booming thunderstorms passing through the area when I was young, it was the Blizzard of 1996 that really caught my attention. I'll never forget the plow trucks struggling to make it down our neighborhood street in the 3 feet of snow. Several years later, an elementary school visit by Al Roker had me yearning to learn more about what it meant to be a meteorologist. Then, in highschool, my mother gifted me a weather station for Christmas. Little did she know that she had created a monster! I was determined to develop a website to inform the locals about the current conditions based on my weather station. And now, here I am nearly 20 years later, fortunate enough to be working at a place I could have only dreamt of as a little kid. -->

I'll never forget the plow trucks struggling to make it down our neighborhood street in the 3 feet of snow. Several years later, an elementary school visit by Al Roker had me yearning to learn more about what it meant to be a meteorologist. Then, in high school, my mother gifted me a weather station for Christmas. These events led me to study the topic that I love in college, earning my B.S. degree in Meteorology from Milersville University (2013) and my M.S. (2015) and Ph.D. (2018) degrees in Atmospheric Science from the University of Wyoming. I then joined NCAR as a Postdoctoral Fellow in 2019.

Now as a research scientist at NCAR, I am broadly interested in boundary layers and turbulence. The boundary layer is the lowest part of the atmosphere in which we live and where all the cool stuff happens. I am especially curious about problems involving numerical weather prediction, with specific interests spanning wildfires, renewable energy, clouds, and interactions across spatial scales. You can find more information about my research happenings on this site. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out!

In my free time, you can find me partaking in outdoor activities (like any good Coloradan), cooking, checking out live music, gardening, and watching sports. Go Birds!
