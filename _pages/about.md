Hi there, I'm Tim! Welcome to my site.

My journey to becoming an atmospheric scientist started many years ago -- in 1996, to be exact. I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, where we got to experience all the seasons. Despite numerous booming thunderstorms passing through the area when I was young, it was the Blizzard of 1996 that really caught my attention. I'll never forget the plow trucks struggling to make it down our neighborhood street in the 3 feet of snow. Several years later, an elementary school visit by Al Roker had me yearning to learn more about what it meant to be a meteorologist. Then, in highschool, my mother gifted me a weather station for Christmas. Little did she know that she had created a monster! I was inspired to create a website to inform the locals about the current conditions based on my weather station. And now, here I am nearly 20 years later, fortunate enough to be working at a place I could have only dreamt of as a little kid.

As a research scientist at NCAR, I am broadly interested in boundary layers and turbulence. The boundary layer is the lowest part of the atmosphere in which we live and where all the cool stuff happens. I am especially curious about problems involving numerical weather prediction, with specific interests including wildland fire prediction, meteorological impacts on renewable energy, and aerosol-cloud interactions. You can find more information about my research happenings on this site. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out!
