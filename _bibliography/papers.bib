  title={An atmospheric hydraulic jump in the Santa Barbara Channel},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and T. R. Parish and D. A. Rahn and D. C. Leon},
  abstract={As part of the Precision Atmospheric Marine Boundary Layer Experiment, the University of Wyoming King Air sampled an atmospheric environment conducive to the formation of a hydraulic jump on 24 May 2012 off the coast of California. Strong, northwesterly flow rounded the Point Arguello–Point Conception complex and encountered the remnants of an eddy circulation in the Santa Barbara Channel. The aircraft flew an east–west vertical sawtooth pattern that captured a sharp thinning of the marine boundary layer and the downstream development of a hydraulic jump. In situ observations show a dramatic rise in isentropes and a coincident sudden decrease in wind speeds. Imagery from the Wyoming Cloud Lidar clearly depicts the jump feature via copolarization and depolarization returns. Estimations of MBL depth are used to calculate the upstream Froude number from hydraulic theory. Simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model produced results in agreement with the observations. The innermost domain uses a 900-m horizontal grid spacing and encompasses the transition from supercritical to subcritical flow south of Point Conception. Upstream Froude number estimations from the model compare well to observations. A strongly divergent wind field, consistent with expansion fan dynamics, is present upwind of the hydraulic jump. The model accurately resolves details of the marine boundary layer collapse into the jump. Results from large-eddy simulations show a large increase in the turbulent kinetic energy field coincident with the hydraulic jump.},

  title={A new perspective on coastally trapped disturbances using data from the satellite era},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and Z. J. Lebo and G. Thompson and D. A. Rahn},
  abstract={The ability of global climate models to simulate accurately marine stratiform clouds continues to challenge the atmospheric science community. These cloud types, which account for a large uncertainty in Earth’s radiation budget, are generally difficult to characterize due to their shallowness and spatial inhomogeneity. Previous work investigating marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds off the California coast has focused on clouds that form under the typical northerly flow regime during the boreal warm season. From about June through September, however, these northerly winds may reverse and become southerly as part of a coastally trapped disturbance (CTD). As the flow surges northward, it is accompanied by a broad cloud deck. Because these events are difficult to forecast, in situ observations of CTDs are few and far between, and little is known about their cloud physical properties. A climatological perspective of 23 CTD events—spanning the years from 2004 to 2016—is presented using several data products, including model reanalyses, buoys, and satellites. For the first time, satellite retrievals suggest that CTD cloud decks may play a unique role in the radiation budget due to a combination of aerosol sources that enhance cloud droplet number concentration and reduce cloud droplet effective radius. This particular type of cloud regime should therefore be treated differently than that which is more commonly found in the summertime months over the northeast Pacific Ocean. The potential influence of a coherent wind stress cycle on sea surface temperatures and sea salt aerosol is also explored.},

  author={Juliano, T. W. and M. M. Coggon and G. Thompson and D. A. Rahn and J. H. Seinfeld and A. Sorooshian and Z. J. Lebo},
  abstract={Modeling marine low clouds and fog in coastal environments remains an outstanding challenge due to the inherently complex ocean–land–atmosphere system. This is especially important in the context of global circulation models due to the profound radiative impact of these clouds. This study utilizes aircraft and satellite measurements, in addition to numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, to examine three well-observed coastally trapped disturbance (CTD) events from June 2006, July 2011, and July 2015. Cloud water-soluble ionic and elemental composition analyses conducted for two of the CTD cases indicate that anthropogenic aerosol sources may impact CTD cloud decks due to synoptic-scale patterns associated with CTD initiation. In general, the dynamics and thermodynamics of the CTD systems are well represented and are relatively insensitive to the choice of physics parameterizations; however, a set of WRF simulations suggests that the treatment of model physics strongly influences CTD cloud field evolution. Specifically, cloud liquid water path (LWP) is highly sensitive to the choice of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme; in many instances, the PBL scheme affects cloud extent and LWP values as much as or more than the microphysics scheme. Results suggest that differences in the treatment of entrainment and vertical mixing in the Yonsei University (nonlocal) and Mellor–Yamada–Janjić (local) PBL schemes may play a significant role. The impact of using different driving models—namely, the North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM) 12-km analysis and the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) 32-km products—is also investigated.},

  abstract={Wind energy applications including wind resource assessment, wind power forecasting, and wind plant optimization require high-resolution mesoscale simulations. High resolution mesoscale simulations are essential for accurate characterization of atmospheric flows over heterogeneous land use and complex terrain. Under such conditions, the assumption of grid-cell homogeneity, used in one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (1D PBL) parameterizations, breaks down. However, in most numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, boundary layer turbulence is parameterized using 1D PBL parameterizations. We have therefore developed a three-dimensional (3D) PBL parameterization to better account for horizontal flow heterogeneities. We have implemented and tested the 3D PBL parameterization in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model. The new parameterization is validated using observations from the Wind Forecast Improvement 2 (WFIP 2) project and compared to 1D PBL results.},

  title={Linking large-scale circulation patterns to low-cloud properties},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and Z. J. Lebo},
  abstract={The North Pacific High (NPH) is a fundamental meteorological feature present during the boreal warm season. Marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds, which are persistent in this oceanic region, are influenced directly by the NPH. In this study, we combine 11 years of reanalysis and an unsupervised machine learning technique to examine the gamut of 850 hPa synoptic-scale circulation patterns. This approach reveals two distinguishable regimes – a dominant NPH setup and a land-falling cyclone – and in between a spectrum of large-scale patterns. We then use satellite retrievals to elucidate for the first time the explicit dependence of MBL cloud properties (namely cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water path, and shortwave cloud radiative effect – CRE$_{SW}$) on 850 hPa circulation patterns over the northeast Pacific Ocean. We find that CRE$_{SW}$ spans from −146.8 to −115.5 W m−2, indicating that the range of observed MBL cloud properties must be accounted for in global and regional climate models. Our results demonstrate the value of combining reanalysis and satellite retrievals to help clarify the relationship between synoptic-scale dynamics and cloud physics.},

  author={Liu, Y. and Y. Qian and S. Feng and L. K. Berg and T. W. Juliano and P. A. Jim\'enez and Y. Liu},
  abstract={We investigate the parametric sensitivity of solar irradiance to a set of parameters within the sub-grid cloud scheme (CLD3) and an upgraded aerosol-aware Thompson-Eidhammer scheme (TE14) in an upcoming enhanced version of the Weather Research and Forecasting-Solar model. We conduct ensemble simulations over the Southern Great Plains and Hanford, California, focusing on the parametric sensitivity under cloudy conditions with different aerosol loading. We adopt the Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling approach to explore the high-dimensional parameter space and apply the generalized linear model to quantify the relative contribution of individual parameters to the total variance. We find that CLD3 parameters related to entrainment and the cloud condensation threshold contribute to most of the variance in the ensemble simulations under less-polluted conditions. Larger entrainment and a higher condensation threshold produce more solar irradiance via decreasing cloud fraction and cloud optical depth. As the sensitivities of cloud fraction and cloud optical properties to perturbed parameters vary with cloud cover, the relative contributions of parameters to irradiance variance also change with cloud cover. As a contrast, under the heavily-polluted wildfire conditions, the model sensitivities to the parameters within the enhanced TE14 scheme become pronounced, especially those related to water-friendly aerosol emission rate and the modal radius of black carbon. The variations of those aerosol parameters cause significant changes in simulated irradiance, especially over the clear sky, suggesting the importance of accurate representation of emission source for aerosols and their precursors.},

  author={Juliano, T. W. and P. A. Jim\'enez and B. Kosovi\'c and T. Eidhammer and G. Thompson and L. K. Berg and J. Fast and A. Motley and A. Polidori},
  abstract={The 2020 wildfire season (May through December) in the United States was exceptionally active, with the National Interagency Fire Center reporting over 10 million acres ($\gt$40 000 km$^{2}$) burned. During the September 2020 wildfire events, large concentrations of smoke particulates were emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, smoke was responsible for ∼10%–30% reduction in solar power production during peak hours as recorded by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) sites. In this study, we focus on a 9 d period in September when wildfire smoke had a profound impact on solar energy production. During the smoke episodes, hour-ahead forecasts utilized by CAISO did not include the effects of smoke and therefore overestimated the expected power production by $\sim$10%–50%. Here we use multiple observational networks and a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to show that the wildfire events of 2020 had a significantly detrimental influence on solar energy production due to high aerosol loading. We find that including the contribution of biomass burning particles greatly improves the day-ahead solar energy bias forecast of both global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance by nearly $\sim$50%. Our results suggest that a more comprehensive treatment of aerosols, including biomass burning aerosols, in NWP models may be an important consideration for energy grid balancing, in addition to solar resource assessment, as solar power reliance increases.},

  author={Eghdami, M. and A. P. Barros and P. A. Jim\'enez and T. W. Juliano and B. Kosovi\'c},
  abstract={Accurate representation of heterogeneous surface layer processes is essential for numerical weather prediction (NWP) with sub-kilometer grid spacing. NWP models such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model generally use second-moment turbulent models for parameterizing the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The most common parameterizations follow Mellor–Yamada and account for the vertical turbulent mixing only; that is, standard PBL parameterizations are one-dimensional (1DPBL). The horizontal diffusion of momentum is parameterized based on Smagorinsky’s model for numerical stability. Although the combination of 1DPBL and 2D Smagorinsky parameterizations is successful at coarse grid resolutions (e.g., grid-size dx ∼ 12–2 km), it does not represent well the effect of horizontal turbulence as gridcell size decreases (<1 km). To reconcile the representation of vertical and horizontal turbulent mixing, a full three-dimensional PBL scheme (3DPBL) based on the Mellor–Yamada model was implemented in WRF. The 3DPBL uses the horizontal and vertical turbulent fluxes diagnosed from the flow gradients to handle the turbulent mixing. These gradients cannot be directly calculated near the surface. Therefore, the 3DPBL parameterization is coupled herein to a second-order diagnostic model of the three-dimensional turbulent fluxes in the surface layer. Several adjustments to the original Mellor–Yamada model, including a modified length scale, were introduced to capture flow anisotropy and dependence on stability conditions. The results are compared against data from the Wind Forecast Improvement Project 2 (WFIP2) for different weather regimes and using different grid resolutions to examine stability and scale dependency.},

  author={Juliano, T. W. and B. Kosovi\'c and P. A. Jim\'enez and M. Eghdami and S. E. Haupt and A. Martilli},
  abstract={Generating accurate weather forecasts of planetary boundary layer (PBL) properties is challenging in many geographical regions, oftentimes due to complex topography or horizontal variability in, for example, land characteristics. While recent advances in high-performance computing platforms have led to an increase in the spatial resolution of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, the horizontal gridcell spacing ($\Delta$x) of many regional-scale NWP models currently fall within or are beginning to approach the gray zone (i.e., $\Delta$x $\approx$ 100–1000 m). At these gridcell spacings, three-dimensional (3D) effects are important, as the most energetic turbulent eddies are neither fully parameterized (as in traditional mesoscale simulations) nor fully resolved [as in traditional large-eddy simulations (LES)]. In light of this modeling challenge, we have implemented a 3D PBL parameterization for high-resolution mesoscale simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. The PBL scheme, which is based on the algebraic model developed by Mellor and Yamada, accounts for the 3D effects of turbulence by calculating explicitly the momentum, heat, and moisture flux divergences in addition to the turbulent kinetic energy. In this study, we present results from idealized simulations in the gray zone that illustrate the benefit of using a fully consistent turbulence closure framework under convective conditions. While the 3D PBL scheme reproduces the evolution of convective features more appropriately than the traditional 1D PBL scheme, we highlight the need to improve the turbulent length scale formulation.},

  author={Arthur, R. S. and T. W. Juliano and B. Adler and R. Krishnamurthy and J. K. Lundquist and B. Kosovi\'c and P. A. Jim\'enez},
  abstract={Cold-air pools (CAPs), or stable atmospheric boundary layers that form within topographic basins, are associated with poor air quality, hazardous weather, and low wind energy output. Accurate prediction of CAP dynamics presents a challenge for mesoscale forecast models in part because CAPs occur in regions of complex terrain, where traditional turbulence parameterizations may not be appropriate. This study examines the effects of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme and horizontal diffusion treatment on CAP prediction in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Model runs with a one-dimensional (1D) PBL scheme and Smagorinsky-like horizontal diffusion are compared with runs that use a new three-dimensional (3D) PBL scheme to calculate turbulent fluxes. Simulations are completed in a nested configuration with 3-km/750-m horizontal grid spacing over a 10-day case study in the Columbia River basin, and results are compared with observations from the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project. Using event-averaged error metrics, potential temperature and wind speed errors are shown to decrease both with increased horizontal grid resolution and with improved treatment of horizontal diffusion over steep terrain. The 3D PBL scheme further reduces errors relative to a standard 1D PBL approach. Error reduction is accentuated during CAP erosion, when turbulent mixing plays a more dominant role in the dynamics. Last, the 3D PBL scheme is shown to reduce near-surface overestimates of turbulence kinetic energy during the CAP event. The sensitivity of turbulence predictions to the master length-scale formulation in the 3D PBL parameterization is also explored.},

  abstract={One of the most intense air mass transformations on Earth happens when cold air flows from frozen surfaces to much warmer open water in cold-air outbreaks (CAOs), a process captured beautifully in satellite imagery. Despite the ubiquity of the CAO cloud regime over high-latitude oceans, we have a rather poor understanding of its properties, its role in energy and water cycles, and its treatment in weather and climate models. The Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) was conducted to better understand this regime and its representation in models. COMBLE aimed to examine the relations between surface fluxes, boundary layer structure, aerosol, cloud, and precipitation properties, and mesoscale circulations in marine CAOs. Processes affecting these properties largely fall in a range of scales where boundary layer processes, convection, and precipitation are tightly coupled, which makes accurate representation of the CAO cloud regime in numerical weather prediction and global climate models most challenging. COMBLE deployed an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility at a coastal site in northern Scandinavia (69°N), with additional instruments on Bear Island (75°N), from December 2019 to May 2020. CAO conditions were experienced 19% (21%) of the time at the main site (on Bear Island). A comprehensive suite of continuous in situ and remote sensing observations of atmospheric conditions, clouds, precipitation, and aerosol were collected. Because of the clouds’ well-defined origin, their shallow depth, and the broad range of observed temperature and aerosol concentrations, the COMBLE dataset provides a powerful modeling testbed for improving the representation of mixed-phase cloud processes in large-eddy simulations and large-scale models.},

  abstract={Disturbance events can happen at a temporal scale much faster than wildland fire fuel data updates. When used as input for wildland fire behavior models, outdated fuel datasets can contribute to misleading forecasts, which have implications for operational firefighting, mitigation, and wildland fire research.

Here, we show a proof of concept using C-band synthetic aperture radar and multispectral imagery, land cover classes, and tree mortality surveys to train a random forest classifier to estimate wildland fire fuel data in the East Troublesome Fire (Colorado) domain. The algorithm classified over 80% of the test dataset correctly, and the resulting wildland fire fuel data was used to simulate the East Troublesome Fire using the coupled atmosphere—wildland fire behavior model, WRF-Fire. The simulation using the modified fuel inputs, where 43% of original fuels are replaced with fuels representing dead trees, improved the burn area forecast by 38%. This study demonstrates the need for up-to-date fuel maps available in real time to provide accurate prediction of wildland fire spread, and outlines the methodology based on high-resolution satellite observations and machine learning that can accomplish this task.},

  abstract={Model parameters are one of the sources of uncertainties in numerical weather prediction. Recently, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Solar extensions (WRF-Solar) has been upgraded by enhancing the treatment of sub-grid scale cloud and aerosols with augmentations of a sub-grid scale cloud scheme (CLD3) and an upgraded aerosol-aware Thompson-Eidhammer scheme (TE14). However, the value of model parameters associated with these parameterizations are assigned based on limited measurements or theoretical calculations. Calibrating the sensitive parameters has the potential to improve solar irradiance predictions. In this work, we adopted a multi-objective surrogate-based optimization (SBO) framework to calibrate nine parameters used in CLD3 and TE14 that lead to the largest sensitivity in simulated irradiance. The normalized mean-absolute-error (NMAE) of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) are minimized by calibrating WRF-Solar over two regions including the Southern Great Plains (SGP) and Central California. We selected two cloudy cases, one over less-polluted SGP and another over Central California with high aerosol loading associated with wildfire events. The results show that generalized linear model (GLM)-based surrogate models approximate physical models well, particularly when the third order and three-way interaction terms are considered. The SBO framework efficiently searches the parameter space for optimal solutions with less computational costs than directly calibrating the physical model. We first calibrate CLD3 parameters over the less-polluted SGP region. Optimized CLD3 parameters alone result in NMAE reduction by 14% for the site-mean and up to 33% for individual cases over the SGP region. With further calibration of TE14 parameters over the Central California during active fire periods, the optimized parameters lead to over 20% reductions of NMAE.},

  abstract={Wind plant wake impacts can be estimated with a number of simulation methodologies, each with its own fidelity and sensitivity to model inputs. In turbine-free mesoscale simulations, hub-height wind speeds often significantly vary with the choice of a planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. However, the sensitivity of wind plant wakes to a PBL scheme has not been explored because, as of the Weather Research and Forecasting model v4.3.3, wake parameterizations were only compatible with one PBL scheme. We couple the Fitch wind farm parameterization with the new NCAR 3DPBL scheme and compare the resulting wakes to those simulated with a widely used PBL scheme. We simulate a wind plant in pseudo-steady states under idealized stable, neutral, and unstable conditions with matching hub-height wind speeds using two PBL schemes: MYNN and the NCAR 3DPBL. For these idealized scenarios, average hub-height wind speed losses within the plant differ between PBL schemes by between −0.20 and 0.22 m s−1, and correspondingly, capacity factors range between 39.5 %–53.8 %. These simulations suggest that PBL schemes represent a meaningful source of modeled wind resource uncertainty; therefore, we recommend incorporating PBL variability into future wind plant planning sensitivity studies as well as wind forecasting studies.},

We evaluated the performance of Weather Research and Forecast-Fire (WRF-Fire), a coupled fire-atmosphere wildland fire simulation platform, in simulating a large historic fire (2018 Camp Fire). Methods. A baseline model based on a setup typically used for WRF-Fire operational applications is utilised to simulate Camp Fire. Simulation results are compared to high-temporal-resolution fire perimeters derived from NEXRAD observations. The sensitivity of the model to a series of modelling parameters and assumptions governing the simulated wind field are then investigated. Results of WRF-Fire for Camp Fire are compared to FARSITE. Key results. Baseline case shows non-negligible discrepancies between the simulated fire and the observations on rate of spread (ROS) and spread direction. Sensitivity analysis results show that refining the atmospheric grid of Camp Fire’s complex terrain improves fire prediction capabilities. Conclusions. Sensitivity studies show the importance of refined atmosphere modelling for wildland fire simulation using WRF-Fire in complex terrains. Compared to FARSITE, WRF-Fire agrees better with the observations in terms of fire propagation rate and direction. Implications. The findings suggest the need for further investigation of other possible sources of wildfire modelling uncertainties and errors.},

A set of large-eddy simulations inspired by unique surface and upper atmospheric observations from the 2021 Santa Coloma de Queralt Fire (Spain) were conducted to investigate the influence of background conditions and interactions between atmospheric and fire processes such as fire smoke, ambient moisture, and latent heat release on the formation and evolution of pyroconvective clouds. While the microphysical impact of BC and OC emissions on the dynamics of fire behavior is minimal on short time scales (<6 hr), their presence increased the cloud water content and decreased the rain rates in our case study. In our case study, atmospheric moisture played an important role in the formation and development of pyroconvective clouds, which in turn enhanced the surface winds (8%) and fire spread rate (25%). The influence of fuel moisture on the pyroconvective cloud formation is smaller when compared with the atmospheric moisture content. A better representation of cloud processes can improve the mesoscale forecasts, which is important for better fire behavior modeling.},

  abstract={On 30 December 2021, the Marshall Fire devastated the Boulder, Colorado region. The fire initiated in fine fuels in open space just southeast of Boulder and spread rapidly due to the strong, downslope winds that penetrated into the Boulder Foothills. Despite the increasing occurrence of wildland-urban interface (WUI) disasters, many questions remain about how fires progress through vegetation and the built environment. To help answer these questions for the Marshall Fire, we use a coupled fire-atmosphere model and Doppler on Wheels (DOW) observations to study the fire's progression as well as examine the physical drivers of its spread. Evaluation of the model using the DOW suggests that the model is able to capture general characteristics of the flow field; however, it does not produce as robust of a hydraulic jump as the one observed. Our results highlight limitations of the model that should be addressed for successful WUI simulations.},

  title={Can we yet do a fairer and more complete validation of wind farm parametrizations in the WRF model?},

  abstract={Wind-farm parametrizations in numerical weather prediction models continue to be developed and used to study the impact of wind farms on both the local climate and other wind farms. Therefore, it is important to evaluate their accuracy in simulating the wind field. Here, we evaluate the Fitch scheme, which is the in-built wind-farm parametrization of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by simulating a small wind farm through idealized simulations in the WRF model. We simulate the wind-farm impact on the atmosphere by using two planetary boundary layer schemes, one of these designed for the terra incognita, a range of scales finer than used for traditional mesoscale simulations, yet still too coarse for large-eddy simulation (LES). For both schemes, we use two horizontal grid spacings, 960 and 240 m, which are typical within the terra incognita. We compare these simulations using the Fitch wind farm parametrization with wakes modelled at high-resolution using the LES capability of the WRF model combined with an actuator disk wind turbine model designed for LES. From this preliminary assessment, we find that the simulations at the coarsest resolution are in better agreement with spatially-averaged outputs of the LES compared to that of the medium-range resolution simulations with LES, which are spatially averaged to the medium size spacing. The medium-range resolution simulations show the greatest velocity differences between the simulations without and with wakes.},
