  title={An atmospheric hydraulic jump in the Santa Barbara Channel},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and T. R. Parish and D. A. Rahn and D. C. Leon},
  abstract={As part of the Precision Atmospheric Marine Boundary Layer Experiment, the University of Wyoming King Air sampled an atmospheric environment conducive to the formation of a hydraulic jump on 24 May 2012 off the coast of California. Strong, northwesterly flow rounded the Point Arguello–Point Conception complex and encountered the remnants of an eddy circulation in the Santa Barbara Channel. The aircraft flew an east–west vertical sawtooth pattern that captured a sharp thinning of the marine boundary layer and the downstream development of a hydraulic jump. In situ observations show a dramatic rise in isentropes and a coincident sudden decrease in wind speeds. Imagery from the Wyoming Cloud Lidar clearly depicts the jump feature via copolarization and depolarization returns. Estimations of MBL depth are used to calculate the upstream Froude number from hydraulic theory. Simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model produced results in agreement with the observations. The innermost domain uses a 900-m horizontal grid spacing and encompasses the transition from supercritical to subcritical flow south of Point Conception. Upstream Froude number estimations from the model compare well to observations. A strongly divergent wind field, consistent with expansion fan dynamics, is present upwind of the hydraulic jump. The model accurately resolves details of the marine boundary layer collapse into the jump. Results from large-eddy simulations show a large increase in the turbulent kinetic energy field coincident with the hydraulic jump.},

  title={A new perspective on coastally trapped disturbances using data from the satellite era},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and Z. J. Lebo and G. Thompson and D. A. Rahn},
  abstract={The ability of global climate models to simulate accurately marine stratiform clouds continues to challenge the atmospheric science community. These cloud types, which account for a large uncertainty in Earth’s radiation budget, are generally difficult to characterize due to their shallowness and spatial inhomogeneity. Previous work investigating marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds off the California coast has focused on clouds that form under the typical northerly flow regime during the boreal warm season. From about June through September, however, these northerly winds may reverse and become southerly as part of a coastally trapped disturbance (CTD). As the flow surges northward, it is accompanied by a broad cloud deck. Because these events are difficult to forecast, in situ observations of CTDs are few and far between, and little is known about their cloud physical properties. A climatological perspective of 23 CTD events—spanning the years from 2004 to 2016—is presented using several data products, including model reanalyses, buoys, and satellites. For the first time, satellite retrievals suggest that CTD cloud decks may play a unique role in the radiation budget due to a combination of aerosol sources that enhance cloud droplet number concentration and reduce cloud droplet effective radius. This particular type of cloud regime should therefore be treated differently than that which is more commonly found in the summertime months over the northeast Pacific Ocean. The potential influence of a coherent wind stress cycle on sea surface temperatures and sea salt aerosol is also explored.},

  title={Marine boundary layer clouds associated with coastally trapped disturbances: Observations and model simulations},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and M. M. Coggon and G. Thompson and D. A. Rahn and J. H. Seinfeld and A. Sorooshian and Z. J. Lebo},
  abstract={Modeling marine low clouds and fog in coastal environments remains an outstanding challenge due to the inherently complex ocean–land–atmosphere system. This is especially important in the context of global circulation models due to the profound radiative impact of these clouds. This study utilizes aircraft and satellite measurements, in addition to numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, to examine three well-observed coastally trapped disturbance (CTD) events from June 2006, July 2011, and July 2015. Cloud water-soluble ionic and elemental composition analyses conducted for two of the CTD cases indicate that anthropogenic aerosol sources may impact CTD cloud decks due to synoptic-scale patterns associated with CTD initiation. In general, the dynamics and thermodynamics of the CTD systems are well represented and are relatively insensitive to the choice of physics parameterizations; however, a set of WRF simulations suggests that the treatment of model physics strongly influences CTD cloud field evolution. Specifically, cloud liquid water path (LWP) is highly sensitive to the choice of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme; in many instances, the PBL scheme affects cloud extent and LWP values as much as or more than the microphysics scheme. Results suggest that differences in the treatment of entrainment and vertical mixing in the Yonsei University (nonlocal) and Mellor–Yamada–Janjić (local) PBL schemes may play a significant role. The impact of using different driving models—namely, the North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM) 12-km analysis and the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) 32-km products—is also investigated.},

  title={Three-dimensional planetary boundary layer parameterization for high-resolution mesoscale simulations},
  author={Kosovi\'c, B. and P. J. Munoz and T. W. Juliano and A. Martilli and M. Eghdami and A. P. Barros and S. E. Haupt},
  abstract={Wind energy applications including wind resource assessment, wind power forecasting, and wind plant optimization require high-resolution mesoscale simulations. High resolution mesoscale simulations are essential for accurate characterization of atmospheric flows over heterogeneous land use and complex terrain. Under such conditions, the assumption of grid-cell homogeneity, used in one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (1D PBL) parameterizations, breaks down. However, in most numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, boundary layer turbulence is parameterized using 1D PBL parameterizations. We have therefore developed a three-dimensional (3D) PBL parameterization to better account for horizontal flow heterogeneities. We have implemented and tested the 3D PBL parameterization in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model. The new parameterization is validated using observations from the Wind Forecast Improvement 2 (WFIP 2) project and compared to 1D PBL results.},

  title={Linking large-scale circulation patterns to low-cloud properties},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and Z. J. Lebo},
  abstract={The North Pacific High (NPH) is a fundamental meteorological feature present during the boreal warm season. Marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds, which are persistent in this oceanic region, are influenced directly by the NPH. In this study, we combine 11 years of reanalysis and an unsupervised machine learning technique to examine the gamut of 850 hPa synoptic-scale circulation patterns. This approach reveals two distinguishable regimes – a dominant NPH setup and a land-falling cyclone – and in between a spectrum of large-scale patterns. We then use satellite retrievals to elucidate for the first time the explicit dependence of MBL cloud properties (namely cloud droplet number concentration, liquid water path, and shortwave cloud radiative effect – CRE$_{SW}$) on 850 hPa circulation patterns over the northeast Pacific Ocean. We find that CRE$_{SW}$ spans from −146.8 to −115.5 W m−2, indicating that the range of observed MBL cloud properties must be accounted for in global and regional climate models. Our results demonstrate the value of combining reanalysis and satellite retrievals to help clarify the relationship between synoptic-scale dynamics and cloud physics.},

  title={Sensitivity of solar irradiance to model parameters in cloud and aerosol treatments of WRF-Solar},
  author={Liu, Y. and Y. Qian and S. Feng and L. K. Berg and T. W. Juliano and P. A. Jim\'enez and Y. Liu},
  abstract={We investigate the parametric sensitivity of solar irradiance to a set of parameters within the sub-grid cloud scheme (CLD3) and an upgraded aerosol-aware Thompson-Eidhammer scheme (TE14) in an upcoming enhanced version of the Weather Research and Forecasting-Solar model. We conduct ensemble simulations over the Southern Great Plains and Hanford, California, focusing on the parametric sensitivity under cloudy conditions with different aerosol loading. We adopt the Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling approach to explore the high-dimensional parameter space and apply the generalized linear model to quantify the relative contribution of individual parameters to the total variance. We find that CLD3 parameters related to entrainment and the cloud condensation threshold contribute to most of the variance in the ensemble simulations under less-polluted conditions. Larger entrainment and a higher condensation threshold produce more solar irradiance via decreasing cloud fraction and cloud optical depth. As the sensitivities of cloud fraction and cloud optical properties to perturbed parameters vary with cloud cover, the relative contributions of parameters to irradiance variance also change with cloud cover. As a contrast, under the heavily-polluted wildfire conditions, the model sensitivities to the parameters within the enhanced TE14 scheme become pronounced, especially those related to water-friendly aerosol emission rate and the modal radius of black carbon. The variations of those aerosol parameters cause significant changes in simulated irradiance, especially over the clear sky, suggesting the importance of accurate representation of emission source for aerosols and their precursors.},

  title={Smoke from 2020 United States wildfires responsible for substantial solar energy forecast errors},
  author={Juliano, T. W. and P. A. Jim\'enez and B. Kosovi\'c and T. Eidhammer and G. Thompson and L. K. Berg and J. Fast and A. Motley and A. Polidori},
  abstract={The 2020 wildfire season (May through December) in the United States was exceptionally active, with the National Interagency Fire Center reporting over 10 million acres ($\gt$40 000 km$^{2}$) burned. During the September 2020 wildfire events, large concentrations of smoke particulates were emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, smoke was responsible for ∼10%–30% reduction in solar power production during peak hours as recorded by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) sites. In this study, we focus on a 9 d period in September when wildfire smoke had a profound impact on solar energy production. During the smoke episodes, hour-ahead forecasts utilized by CAISO did not include the effects of smoke and therefore overestimated the expected power production by $\sim$10%–50%. Here we use multiple observational networks and a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to show that the wildfire events of 2020 had a significantly detrimental influence on solar energy production due to high aerosol loading. We find that including the contribution of biomass burning particles greatly improves the day-ahead solar energy bias forecast of both global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance by nearly $\sim$50%. Our results suggest that a more comprehensive treatment of aerosols, including biomass burning aerosols, in NWP models may be an important consideration for energy grid balancing, in addition to solar resource assessment, as solar power reliance increases.},
